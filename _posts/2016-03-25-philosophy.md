**The Creationis**t isn't about where we **(humans)** came from, or who **created** us; on the **contrary**, this**idea** moves **beyond** that.

I **believe**, we're all created to create, and this is why I'm here; to spread this message. A **message** that inspires people to **believe** in their ability to **create**, a **vision** that challenges our **perception** about who we are as **individuals**. 

With this**vision** in mind, let us**imagine** and**create** a place, where **we** as human beings can come**together** with our **differences**, to create a better **world**.

This **idea** isn't for **everyone**, but this idea is for the **chosen** few, who do **believe**; so ill leave **you **with this: How can you**touch**, **move** and **inspire** those around **you**, to create a better**tomorrow**?
